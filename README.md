Predicting Healthcare System Efficiency Relative to National Income

This repository contains the complete code and analysis for the MIS 545 final project Predicting Healthcare System Efficiency Relative to National Income. The project constructs a Healthcare Efficiency Index (HEI) by regressing life expectancy on GDP per capita, then applies supervised machine learning models to examine which structural, behavioral, and environmental factors drive cross-country differences in healthcare efficiency.

The main notebook includes the full workflow used in the project, including data preparation, preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and interpretability analysis.

Contents

1. Preprocessing pipelines for imputation, scaling, and integrated data handling

2. Model development for Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and a neural network

3. Cross-validation and evaluation outputs used in the final analysis

4. SHAP interpretability analysis for global and local feature contributions

5. Figures generated for the final report

Reproducibility

All code in this repository corresponds directly to the analysis presented in the written final report submitted for MIS 545. Running the notebook end-to-end will reproduce the models, figures, and results referenced in the report.
