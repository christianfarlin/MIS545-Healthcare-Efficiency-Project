# MIS545-Healthcare-Efficiency-Project
This repository contains the code, preprocessing pipelines, and analysis used in the MIS 545 final project Predicting Healthcare System Efficiency Relative to National Income. The project constructs a Healthcare Efficiency Index (HEI) by regressing life expectancy on GDP per capita and uses supervised learning models to analyze which system, behavioral, and environmental factors explain cross-country differences in efficiency.

The repository includes:

1. Preprocessing pipelines for imputation, scaling, and data integration

2. Model training scripts for Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and a neural network

3. Cross-validation and evaluation outputs

4. SHAP analysis for global and local interpretability

5. All figures used in the final report

6. The final notebook containing the complete workflow

This codebase supports full reproducibility of the project’s results and corresponds to the written final report submitted for MIS 545.
